# Build Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### ✅ **PaymentStatus Enum Conflict**
**Problem**: Duplicate `PaymentStatus` enum definitions causing ambiguous type lookup
**Solution**: 
- Extended existing `PaymentStatus` enum in `Payment.swift` to include new cases
- Added cases: `.invoiced`, `.partiallyPaid`, `.received` 
- Added `color` and `icon` computed properties
- Removed duplicate enum definition from `JobSetupFlowView.swift`

### ✅ **PaymentStatus Case Updates** 
**Problem**: Old code referencing `.paid` case which was renamed to `.received`
**Fixes**:
- `MockDataService.swift:179`: Changed `.paid` to `.received`
- `JobDetailView.swift:404`: Updated switch statement to handle new cases

### ✅ **CurrencyOptionView Name Conflict**
**Problem**: Duplicate `CurrencyOptionView` struct definitions
**Solution**: 
- Renamed in `NewOnboardingView.swift` to `OnboardingCurrencyOptionView`
- Updated all references to use the new name

### ✅ **Deprecated onChange API**
**Problem**: Using deprecated `onChange(of:perform:)` syntax
**Solution**: 
- Updated to use new iOS 17+ syntax: `onChange(of:) { _, newValue in }`
- Fixed in `JobSetupFlowView.swift` (2 locations)

### ✅ **Payment Model Enhancements**
**Improvements**:
- Added SwiftUI import to `Payment.swift` for Color support
- Enhanced `isOverdue` and `isUpcoming` computed properties to include `.invoiced` status
- Added proper display names, colors, and icons for all payment statuses

## Warning Notes
There are some existing warnings in the codebase that were not addressed:

- Deprecated GoTrueError reference in SupabaseManager

These warnings don't affect functionality but can be addressed in future cleanup.
